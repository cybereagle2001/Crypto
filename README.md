- this script is created by cybereagle2001, oussama ben hadj dahman, developped by cybereagle2001 and Oussema Aloui.
- I thought that it so important to secure some documents it will allow people to conserve their own privacy so I created the first version of Crypto based on some kali linux tools. -It's so easy to use. All what you need is to write or past your text after choosing the encryption or decryption option and Crypto will create a new file where you will found your document encrypted or decrypted.
- Crypto V2.0 is written in python 2.7. We developped Crypto so that it can run on GNU/LINUX ,WINDOWS and MAC OS. We will continue to develope Crypto for higher quality very soon.

## Crypto History
- I got the idea of Crypto script 10/03/2020
- I started by a basic encryption algorythm wich is base64 
- One day my freind asked me to improve the script by saying that it's easier to use the online encryptor so I decided to add more optons to crypto by useing rot13 algorithm.
- I did not stop there because I thought I must have a special encryption algorthm wich allow Crypto to be unique so that today Sun 26 Apr 2020 01:13:55 PM UTC I added crypto1 a encryption and decryption unique algorithm wich will allow more security to your files. 
- Since the begining of the year 2021 we strated to develpe crypto so that it can run on different Operating Systems.
- Crypto is now written using python 2.7 you will find two versions one for Linux and MacOS and an other for Windows users. Note that there is no difference betweeen the two version when it comes to the quality of the encryption and the security of the script, yet for Windows users please vrify that all Requirements are installed.
