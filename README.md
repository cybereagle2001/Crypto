# Crypto
this script is created by cybereagle2001, oussama ben hadj dahman, I thought that it so important to secure some documents that will allow people to conserve their own privacy so I created Crypto based on some kali linux tools. it's so easy to use. All what you need is to write or past your text after useing the encryption or decryption option and Crypto will create a new file where you will found your document encrypted or decrypted.
