- I thought that it so important to secure some documents it will allow people to conserve their own privacy so I created Crypto based on some kali linux tools. -It's so easy to use. All what you need is to write or past your text after useing the encryption or decryption option and Crypto will create a new file where you will found your document encrypted or decrypted.

## Crypto History
- I got the idea of Crypto script 10/03/2020
- I started by a basic encryption algorythm wich is base64 
- One day my freind asked me to improve the script by saying that it's easier to use the online encryptor so I decided to add more optons to crypto by useing rot13 algorithm.
- I did not stop there because I thought I must have a special encryption algorthm wich allow Crypto to be unique so that today Sun 26 Apr 2020 01:13:55 PM UTC I added crypto1 a encryption and decryption unique algorithm wich will allow more security to your files.
